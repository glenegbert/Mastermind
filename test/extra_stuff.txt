is a game with
two players, you and the computer.  The
computer generates a series of 4 letters
that may (or may not) represent these 4
colors (G)reen, (Y)ellow (B)lue and (R)ed.
You will not see this series but you get to
guess what it is.  After each time you guess
the computer will tell you two pieces of informat:
1. How many colors you guessed correctly 2. How
many correct colors you have in the correct position.
The goal is to guess the series that the computer
generated in as few attempts as possible.
